4.Colorful Number
        Problem Description

        Given a number A, find if it is COLORFUL number or not.

        If number A is a COLORFUL number return 1 else, return 0.

        What is a COLORFUL Number:

        A number can be broken into different consecutive sequence of digits. 
        The number 3245 can be broken into sequences like 3, 2, 4, 5, 32, 24, 45, 324, 245 and 3245. 
        This number is a COLORFUL number, since the product of every consecutive sequence of digits is different



        Problem Constraints

        1 <= A <= 2 * 109



        Input Format

        The first and only argument is an integer A.



        Output Format

        Return 1 if integer A is COLORFUL else return 0.



        Example Input

        Input 1:

        A = 23
        Input 2:

        A = 236


        Example Output

        Output 1:

        1
        Output 2:

        0
5.Coloring a Cycle Graph
          Problem Description

                    Given the number of vertices A in a Cyclic Graph.




                    Your task is to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the graph so that no two Adjacent vertices have the same color.


                    A cyclic graph with A vertices is a graph with A edges, such that it forms a loop. See example test case explanation for more details.





                    Problem Constraints

                    3 <= A <= 109



                    Input Format

                    First argument is an integer A denoting the number of vertices in the Cyclic Graph.



                    Output Format

                    Return an single integer denoting the minimum number of colors required to color the graph so that no two Adjacent vertices have the same color.



                    Example Input

                    Input 1:

                    5
                    Input 2:

                    4


                    Example Output

                    Output 1:

                    3
                    Output 2:

                    2


                    Example Explanation

                    Explanation 1:
                    ![alt text](image.png)

                    
                    Color required = 3
                    Explanation 2:
                    ![alt text](image-1.png)
                    
                    Color required = 2
